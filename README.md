This github repo is my first full stack application built from the ground up. I built this app in the last 2 weeks of DevMountain.
Major tech used was AngularJs, Massive, Express, Node, Postgresql and all of it was written in javascript.
Major challenges of this project were setting up a full stack application that had a working database and was hosted.
Other challenges included figuring out authentication, resolves on routes, and setting up the ability to authenticate with google.
As I get more time to come back to this app, there are many changes I will make including adding Bcrypt, the ability to create your own account
and make it more dynamic and user friendly.
